However, 30% of the way through the download, his internet connection drops, causing a 15-minute delay while he resets his router. After the reset, Alex has to restart the download from the beginning. How long does it take for Alex to successfully download the game?",
            "First, calculate the initial download time. 30% of the 150 GB game is \(0.3 \times 150 = 45\) GB. At a rate of 3 GB per minute, it takes \(\frac{45}{3} = 15\) minutes to download 45 GB. Next, account for the internet connection drop and the router reset, which takes 15 minutes. Then, calculate the total time for the entire download after the reset. Since the download restarts from the beginning, the total file size is 150 GB. At a rate of 3 GB per minute, it takes \(\frac{150}{3} = 50\) minutes to download 150 GB. Finally, sum all the times: initial download time (15 minutes), reset time (15 minutes), and final download time (50 minutes). Therefore, the total time is \(15 + 15 + 50 = 80\) minutes."
